//! The `FailTask` service: `running -> failed` (and `queued -> failed` via TTL).
//!
//! [`FailTaskService::fail`] records a [`FailureReason`], stamps `finished_at`,
//! and flips the row to `failed`. Like the other finalize services it is
//! idempotent: a replayed fail of an already-`failed` row returns
//! [`FinalizeOutcome::AlreadyTerminal`]; a row that lost to `done` / `cancelled`
//! returns [`FinalizeError::TerminalMismatch`].
//!
//! `running -> failed` is the runner's path; `queued -> failed` is the P1.4
//! queued-TTL sweeper's path. Both are legal source states, so the failure
//! service accepts either.
