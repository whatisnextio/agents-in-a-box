//! The `ClaimTask` service: atomic `queued -> dispatched` claim.
//!
//! [`ClaimTaskService::claim_for_runtime`] is the head of the daemon's work
//! loop: a runtime polls for the most urgent (then oldest) `queued` task it
//! owns, atomically flips it to `dispatched`, and stamps `dispatched_at`. The
//! whole transition is one
//! `UPDATE ... WHERE id = (SELECT ... LIMIT 1) RETURNING *` statement so two
//! daemons (or two poll iterations) can never claim the same row — `SQLite`
//! serialises the write and `RETURNING` reports exactly the row this statement
//! mutated. An empty queue is `Ok(None)` (the caller sleeps and retries), not an
//! error.
//!
//! # Per-agent concurrency cap
//!
//! The candidate `SELECT` excludes any task whose agent already has
//! `max_concurrent_tasks` rows **in flight** — i.e. already `dispatched` or
//! `running` (the reference's `CountRunningTasks` guard, `task.go:761`, widened to
//! the post-claim set). This keeps a single agent from being dispatched more
//! concurrent work than its runtime can handle. The count and the claim happen
//! in one statement, so the cap holds even under concurrent claims.
//!
//! The in-flight set **must** include `dispatched`, not just `running`: a
//! claim flips a row `queued -> dispatched`, and only later does
//! [`StartTaskService::start`](crate::service::start) flip it
//! `dispatched -> running`. If the cap counted only `running`, then between a
//! claim and its start the just-claimed slot would be invisible — so several
//! daemons polling the same runtime could each see `running` below the cap and
//! each claim a row, over-dispatching the agent past `max_concurrent_tasks`
//! once those `dispatched` rows all reach `running` (e38.27). Counting
//! `dispatched` closes that race: the claim that stamps `dispatched`
//! immediately consumes a slot a concurrent claim can see.
//!
//! # Per-(issue, agent) active-set guard
//!
//! The candidate `SELECT` also excludes any issue task whose agent already has
//! another *active* (`queued` / `dispatched` / `running`) task for the same
//! issue — the `NOT EXISTS` guard from the reference's `ClaimAgentTask`
//! (`pkg/db/queries/agent.sql`). Work on one issue serialises per **agent**,
//! not globally: a different agent's task on the same issue stays claimable, so
//! several agents can work one issue in parallel. Pairs with the
//! `idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent` partial unique index (migration
//! 0012), which already forbids two *pending* rows per (issue, agent); the
//! guard extends that exclusion to the `running` set at claim time. Tasks with
//! `issue_id IS NULL` (chat / autopilot) bypass the guard entirely.
//!
//! Mirrors the reference control plane's `task.go` claim path.
