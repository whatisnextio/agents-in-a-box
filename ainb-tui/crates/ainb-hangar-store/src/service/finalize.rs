//! The shared idempotent-finalize primitive.
//!
//! Every FSM finalize service in P1.3 (Start / Complete / Fail / Cancel) drives
//! exactly one transition on an `agent_task_queue` row.
//!
//! Each must behave identically when the transition is *replayed* — a
//! crashed-and-retried daemon, a WS-vs-HTTP race (arch review §6), or a sweeper
//! racing the runner. [`finalize_idempotent`] captures that one behaviour so the
//! four services share it verbatim.
//!
//! # The algorithm (reference control plane `task.go:1010` idempotent finalize)
//!
//! 1. Run a conditional UPDATE that only fires when the row is in one of
//!    `expected_from` and reports `rows_affected`.
//! 2. `rows_affected == 1` → the caller won the transition →
//!    [`FinalizeOutcome::Transitioned`].
//! 3. `rows_affected == 0` → the row was *not* in an expected source state.
//!    Re-read its current status and decide deterministically:
//!    - status == `target` → the transition already happened (idempotent
//!      replay) → [`FinalizeOutcome::AlreadyTerminal`] (success),
//!    - status is a *different* terminal state → another finalizer won with a
//!      different outcome → [`FinalizeError::TerminalMismatch`] (we must never
//!      silently flip one terminal state into another),
//!    - status is a non-terminal state we did not expect (e.g. starting a
//!      `queued` task, or the row vanished) → [`FinalizeError::IllegalState`].
//!
//! Because the conditional UPDATE is a single statement, `SQLite` serialises
//! concurrent writers: the first transactional UPDATE wins and the loser falls
//! through the `rows_affected == 0` branch above, re-reads, and resolves cleanly.
