//! Typed repository wrapper over the `agent_task_queue` table.
//!
//! [`TaskRepo`] is a thin, stateless sqlx layer covering the *read + enqueue*
//! surface P0 needs: [`TaskRepo::insert`] writes the initial `queued` row,
//! [`TaskRepo::get_by_id`] reads one back, and [`TaskRepo::list_pending_for_runtime`]
//! lists the non-terminal queue for a runtime.
//!
//! # Partial-unique invariant
//!
//! At most one *pending* (`queued` or `dispatched`) task may exist per
//! `(issue_id, agent_id)` pair, enforced by the partial unique index
//! `idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent` (migration 0012, replacing the 0004
//! global-per-issue scope). An [`TaskRepo::insert`] of a second pending task
//! for the same issue **and the same agent** therefore returns a `sqlx::Error`
//! UNIQUE-constraint violation rather than silently double-queueing — this is
//! how the enqueue path coalesces duplicate fires, while *different* agents
//! may each queue work on one issue in parallel (the reference's per-(issue, agent)
//! model, `pkg/db/queries/agent.sql` `ClaimAgentTask`). Tasks with a `NULL`
//! `issue_id` (chat / autopilot placeholders) are excluded from the index and
//! never collide.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! There are deliberately **no state-transition methods** here (`claim`,
//! `start`, `complete`, `fail`, `cancel`, `reclaim_stale_dispatched`,
//! `sweep_expired_queued`). Those belong to the P1 daemon FSM, which builds on
//! these read/enqueue primitives.
