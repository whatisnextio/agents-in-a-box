//! Agent CLI subprocess execution — the `claude` provider (P1.7).
//!
//! [`Runner::run_claude`] spawns the `claude` binary inside a task's isolated
//! [`ExecEnv`], with a **deny-by-default** env (only the 12-var allowlist passes
//! through — see [`ENV_ALLOWLIST`]), streams its JSONL stdout line-by-line to
//! `{logs}/claude.jsonl`, pins the first `session_id` it sees, and enforces a
//! hard runtime deadline (kill on timeout). Mirrors the reference control plane's
//! `daemon.go` session-pinning + allowlisted-exec pattern.
//!
//! # Provider abstraction
//!
//! `claude` shipped in P1. The orchestration here (env build, JSONL tee, session
//! pin, timeout, OS sandbox) is provider-agnostic — captured once in
//! [`Runner::run_provider`] and parameterised by a [`ProviderSpec`] (the wire
//! name, the per-provider log file, and the argv to spawn). e38.16 adds the
//! `codex` exec path ([`Runner::run_codex`]) as a second `ProviderSpec` rather
//! than a fork of the run loop, so a third provider is one more spec.
//!
//! # Outcome classification
//!
//! The runner does **not** itself touch the database. It returns a
//! [`RunOutcome`] the daemon's claim loop maps onto the FSM. It finalizes on the
//! provider's OWN structured terminal event (beads 48c/48d) — parsed from the
//! `--output-format stream-json` (claude) / `--json` (codex) stream — NOT the
//! bare exit code, because an agent CLI exits 0 on refusals and empty runs:
//! - structured success + clean exit → [`RunOutcome::Success`] → daemon
//!   `CompleteTask`,
//! - structured error / refusal / max-turns (any exit code, incl. 0) →
//!   [`RunOutcome::Failed`] with the mapped reason ([`FailureReason::IterationLimit`]
//!   for `error_max_turns`, else [`FailureReason::AgentError`]),
//! - **exit 0 with NO success terminal** → [`RunOutcome::Failed`] with
//!   [`FailureReason::AgentError`] — the "done over no work" hole (48d),
//! - exit [`EX_TEMPFAIL`] (75) with no success terminal → [`RunOutcome::Failed`]
//!   with [`FailureReason::RuntimeOffline`] — the infra/retryable failure the
//!   daemon's retry chain (e38.28) re-dispatches as a child task,
//! - any other non-zero exit with no success terminal → [`RunOutcome::Failed`]
//!   with [`FailureReason::AgentError`],
//! - deadline exceeded → kill → [`RunOutcome::Failed`] with
//!   [`FailureReason::Timeout`].

    ///   footgun this surface already rejected once. A required flag is not a
    ///   policy knob.
    /// * The blast radius is bounded by the FS sandbox (Seatbelt/Landlock) and the
    ///   deny-by-default env allowlist, but NOT eliminated: within the sandbox the
    ///   agent may still execute arbitrary commands and reach the network. This is
    ///   the same trust posture the daemon already warns about at dispatch
    ///   (`warnings::danger-full-access`), so copilot is not a new exposure class
    ///   — it is the existing one made explicit in argv.
    /// * Claude's permission policy is now resolved too, and it was NOT the same
    ///   route: an earlier note here assumed claude "reaches the same place by a
    ///   different route" under `--print`. Measured against 2.1.210, it did not —
    ///   a flagless `-p` run DENIED the tool, wrote nothing, and exited 0, which
    ///   the daemon scored as success. Claude now carries
    ///   `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by operator decision, so both providers
    ///   are explicit in argv and equally wide.

    /// * [`Mode::Headless`] → `-p <prompt>`: "Execute a prompt in non-interactive
