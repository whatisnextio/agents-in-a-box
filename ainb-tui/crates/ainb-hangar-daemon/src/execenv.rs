//! Per-task execution-environment layout (P1.6).
//!
//! Every dispatched task gets an isolated on-disk sandbox so its working tree,
//! emitted artifacts, and provider logs never collide with another task's. The
//! layout mirrors the reference's (`build-plan.md:40`, `CLI_AND_DAEMON.md:185-193`):
//!
//! ```text
//! {home}/.agents-in-a-box/hangar/workspaces/{ws_slug}/{shortID}/
//! ├── workdir/        # the agent's CWD (a git worktree for issue tasks)
//! ├── output/         # emitted artifacts (patches, diffs)
//! ├── logs/           # provider JSONL streams (claude.jsonl, …)
//! └── .gc_meta.json   # GC marker: who owns this dir + when it was seen
//! ```
//!
//! The `{shortID}` path segment is the task's FULL ULID (tcp vpm): keying the
//! per-task tree on the whole id makes a path collision impossible, where any
//! truncated slug (the pre-T4 first-8-chars, or the T4 first-8-plus-last-6) could
//! in principle collide and cross-wire two runs' worktree / logs / output. Readers
//! ([`logs_dir_candidates`]) still fall back through the two legacy slug schemes so
//! a run written before this change resolves. Because the ULID is injected via
//! [`crate`]'s id-generation seam in tests, the path is deterministic across runs.
//!
//! # GC marker
//!
//! `.gc_meta.json` lets the orphan scanner ([`cleanup`] with
//! [`CleanupKind::OrphanScan`]) distinguish a live task dir from a leaked one:
//! a dir with no marker whose mtime is older than 72h is a leak and is removed.
//! [`prepare_env`] is idempotent — a re-`prepare_env` (e.g. a resumed task)
//! reuses the dirs and only refreshes `.gc_meta.json.last_seen_at`, never
//! clobbering an existing `workdir/`.
