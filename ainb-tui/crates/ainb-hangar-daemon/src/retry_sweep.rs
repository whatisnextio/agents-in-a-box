//! The daemon-wide retry sweep: LLM-free auto-`continue` of transient API
//! errors, with no ATC instance anywhere in the picture.
//!
//! ```text
//! [session ERR] --transient pattern--> [count < cap] --> send "continue"
//!                      |                      |
//!                      |                      +- count++ in atc_retry
//!                      |
//!                      +--off ERR roster for the grace window--> [budget back]
//!
//! [count == cap] --> raise_escalation --> attention row --> ERR chip xN
//! ```
//!
//! Three things make this safe to run against the whole fleet unattended:
//!
//! - **Only transient API errors are touched.** `attention_state = 'ERROR'` is
//!   set by generic hook and wire signals, not by an API-pattern match, so the
//!   roster mixes "the provider returned 529" with "your build is broken". The
//!   sweep re-applies [`detect_error_signals`] to the session's own recent
//!   events and leaves anything it cannot recognise for a human. Typing
//!   `continue` at a real failure is how an agent gets talked into repeating a
//!   destructive step nobody watched.
//! - **The budget is durable and capped.** Every continue is stamped in the
//!   `atc_retry` ledger under this sweep's own reserved instance, and a session
//!   that reaches [`DEFAULT_ERR_RETRY_CAP`] escalates to a human exactly once
//!   instead of looping forever, through the same attention pipeline every
//!   other input request uses.
//! - **A live ATC wins.** ATC's own beat drives `continue` into erroring panes
//!   from a fleet-wide roster, so both would type into one pane. Ownership is
//!   re-read every tick rather than cached at boot, because `atc setup` /
//!   `atc disable` land between ticks.
