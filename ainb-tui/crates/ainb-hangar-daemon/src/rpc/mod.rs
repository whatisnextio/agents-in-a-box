//! The daemon's `UnixListener` JSON-RPC server (P4.10).
//!
//! P3.7's plugin dials `~/.agents-in-a-box/hangar.sock` through the host `unix_socket_dial`
//! cap and speaks the [`ainb_hangar_proto`] JSON-RPC envelope over LSP-style
//! Content-Length framing. P1's daemon never opened that socket — its `boot()`
//! ran the claim-loop FSM only. This module is the missing listener: it binds the
//! socket, accepts plugin connections, decodes framed requests, and answers
//! `workspace/subscribe`, `ping`, and the four P4 snapshot RPCs
//! ([`crate::rpc::snapshots`]) backed by the store repos.
//!
//! ## Wire shape
//!
//! Identical framing to the plugin's [`encode_request`](super) side: each frame
//! is `Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n` followed by `N` bytes of JSON-RPC envelope.
//! [`read_frame`] reassembles one request; [`encode_frame`] frames one response.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! Each accepted connection gets its own task; the shared [`SqlitePool`] is
//! cheaply cloned per connection (sqlx pools are internally reference-counted).
//! The dispatcher ([`dispatch`]) is `async` but holds no per-connection mutable
//! state, so two plugins (e.g. a TUI + a CLI probe) can be served in parallel
//! without coordination.
//!
//! ## Event push (e38.2)
//!
//! Responses and pushed `hangar/event` notifications share one connection, so
//! each connection runs a dedicated **writer task** fed by an mpsc channel:
//! the request loop queues response frames, and — once the (authenticated)
//! connection has issued `workspace/subscribe` for a known workspace — a
//! per-connection **forwarder task** taps the daemon-global
//! [`crate::events::EventBroker`], filters to the subscribed workspace's
//! resolved row id, and queues notification frames onto the same channel.
//! Connection close tears both tasks down, deregistering the subscription.
//! Unauthenticated connections never reach the subscribe path (the auth gate
//! closes them first), so only authenticated, subscribed connections ever
//! receive event frames.
