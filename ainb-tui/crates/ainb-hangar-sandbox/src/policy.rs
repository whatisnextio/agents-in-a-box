//! The OS-agnostic confinement policy: which paths the confined child may read
//! and write, and whether network egress is allowed.

use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

/// Filesystem-confinement policy for a spawned provider subprocess.
///
/// The policy is OS-agnostic; each per-OS backend translates it into a Seatbelt
/// profile (macOS) or a Landlock ruleset (Linux). The defaults are the
/// secret-leak boundary: the child can read the system roots a real agent needs
/// and read/write only the task's isolated roots — it CANNOT read the operator's
/// `$HOME`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc., which is the exfiltration path this bead
/// closes.
///
/// # There is deliberately no Keychain / securityd grant
///
/// A confined provider whose credential lives in the macOS login Keychain cannot
/// reach it (`deny default` blocks the securityd mach-lookup), so a headless run
/// fails "Not logged in". Do NOT fix that by re-allowing
/// `mach-lookup (global-name "com.apple.SecurityServer")`. That grant was built,
/// measured, and removed:
///
/// * It is not per-item. Under this exact profile,
///   `security find-generic-password -s 'Chrome Safe Storage' -w` goes from
///   `DENIED rc=44` to returning the secret, silently and with no prompt — and
///   that item is the master key for every Chrome-saved password, not the
///   agent's own token. "securityd still arbitrates which items the caller may
///   have" FAILS OPEN for any item that is ACL-permissive (`-A`) or was ever
///   marked "Always Allow".
/// * It cannot be scoped to one caller: the profile allows `process-exec*`, so a
///   confined agent simply spawns `/usr/bin/security`.
/// * With `allow_network` also on, and briefs built from board issue text, the
///   chain prompt-injection -> `security` -> egress is complete.
///
/// The supported path is to inject the credential as an env var from the
/// UNSANDBOXED parent daemon (`claude setup-token` ->
/// `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`), which needs no grant into `$HOME` at all. Until
/// that lands, a headless run needs `HANGAR_DAEMON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`.
