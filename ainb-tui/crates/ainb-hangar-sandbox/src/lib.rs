//! OS-level filesystem confinement for the spawned agent provider subprocess
//! (e38.23).
//!
//! The Hangar daemon already denies the provider child the daemon's secrets via
//! a 12-var env allowlist + deny family + process-group kill, but **nothing
//! confines the child's ambient filesystem**: a spawned agent runs with the
//! daemon user's full read/write access to `$HOME`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, etc.
//! Before non-`claude` providers (codex/copilot/gemini) land, the spawned
//! process must be confined so it can only touch the task's isolated roots.
//!
//! This crate is a thin, per-OS **spawn wrapper**:
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌──────────────┐  program +   ┌──────────────────┐  confined  ┌───────────┐
//! │ Runner       │  SandboxPolicy│ sandboxed_command │  Command  │ provider  │
//! │ (daemon)     │─────────────▶│ (per-OS cfg)      │──────────▶│ subprocess│
//! └──────────────┘              └──────────────────┘            └───────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! - **macOS** ([`imp_macos`]): generates a Seatbelt (`.sb`) profile that
//!   `deny default`s file reads/writes, re-allows reads of the system roots a
//!   real agent needs (`/usr`, `/System`, `/Library`, the dynamic linker, the
//!   provider binary, the read roots) and writes only to the task roots (+
//!   temp), allows network egress to the model API, then execs the program
//!   under `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -p <profile> -- <program> …`. No `unsafe`.
//! - **Linux** ([`imp_linux`]): builds a Landlock ruleset that grants the child
//!   read/exec on the read roots and read/write on the write roots, then applies
//!   it via a `pre_exec` hook so the confinement lands in the forked child
//!   *before* exec — never on the daemon. Network is left to a follow-up
//!   (seccomp); FS confinement is the secret-leak boundary this bead delivers.
//! - **Any other OS / primitive unavailable**: the wrapper returns the program
//!   *unconfined* with [`Enforcement::None`] so the daemon still runs the
//!   `claude` provider, and the confinement test SKIPs rather than vacuously
//!   passing. A no-op is never reported as enforcement.
//!
//! # Default-on, overridable
//!
//! [`sandboxed_command`] confines by default. A caller that must opt out (the
//! existing `claude` provider keeps working either way — it only needs network
//! and the workdir, both allowed) can branch on [`SandboxPolicy::disabled`] and
//! [`Enforcement`] without touching this crate's internals.
